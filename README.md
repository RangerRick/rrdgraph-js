RRDGraph-JS â€” RRDGraph implementation in client-side JavaScript
===============================================================

RRDGraph-JS is an implementation of RRDGraph, which allows one to use RRDTool
graph commands to draw graphs in the browser. In addition to static graphs,
realtime graphs are also supported.

Installation / Usage
--------------------

1. Download [`d3.js`](http://d3js.org)

2. Download the [`rrdgraph.js`](https://github.com/vladbarinov/rrdgraph-js/blob/master/rrdgraph.js) script.

3. Add a div where you want the graph to be on the page.

4. Add this code to an .onload event (pure JS, jQuery, d3; it does not matter):
    ``` javascript
    // selector - selects the div(s) you added earlier
    // rrd_command - the RRD command, which defines the graph
    //
    // selector can be omitted, the script will then use the data-src parameter of the div
    // if data-src is used, RRDGraph.get.config and RRDGraph.get.data must be defined somewhere
    var graphs = RRDGraph.init(selector, rrd_command);
    ```

5. To add data to the graph, there are two methods:

    1. Preconsolidated data
        ``` javascript
        var graph = graphs[i];
        graph.data.push([
          {
            def: 'defname',
            points: [
              {
                t: timestamp,
                v: value
              }
            ]
          }
        ]);
        ```

        This data will be immediately added to the graph.
    2. Realtime metrics
        ``` javascript
        // metricId to rrd:ds_name mappings
        var mappings = {
          'metricId1' : 'rrd_name:ds_name'
        };
        var graph = graphs[i];
        var dc = new RRDGraph.DataCollector(graph.config, graph.data, mappings);
        dc.push([
          {
            metricId: 'metricId1',
            timeStamp: timestamp,
            value: value
          }
        ]);
        ```

        The metrics will be consolidated according to the RRD command and pushed when enough metrics
        have been collected to create data points.
